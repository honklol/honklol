## Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋
Hi! I'm a guy making stuff when he's bored. I'm currently learning PHP, Java and Vue. I also play Minecraft when I'm bored too.
And I sometimes code discord.js/discord.py bots when I'm bored, but I most of the time use discord.js now that discord.py has been discontinued.

The GitHub stats card isn't accurate about total commits. There was many more commits, but they were in private repos.
